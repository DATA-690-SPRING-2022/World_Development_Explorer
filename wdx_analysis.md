# A Report comparing Food production, Agricultural land and Food insecurities in people.
### Individual Project PART-A
Name: Snigdha Panakanti <br/>

### INTRODUCTION:
Agriculture provides the largest share of food supplies and ensures a critical number of ecosystem services all over the world. Though all the countries are rich in producing food, there are also some insecuirities/scarcity of food in the population.
This report explains the detail analysis of food production, agricultural land area, food insecurities in people and their undernourishment among the three countries over the period of 8 years (2010-2018).
### Analysis and Strategy:
Countries considered:India, USA, Thailand. <br/>
Time Span: 2010 - 2018 <br/>
Data Source: http://www.worlddev.xyz <br/>
Indicators: 
  - Population in total
  - Food Production index
  - Agricultural Land (% of land area)
  - Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population (%)
  - Prevalence of undernourishment (% of population) 
<br/> 
The total agricultural land area in percentage of three countries is shown below in the bar chart. <br/>

- Agricultural Land changes in each country over the span of 2010-2018 is given in the graph below. There is a consistency in the agricultural land area in India throughout the period. United States has a slight decrease in its land percentage during 2011-2013 and then it has increased back to around 40% of the land. Whereas, Thailand have the least area around 10% and increased over the period of 2011-2013 to 40%. <br/>

- The permanent cropland in the countries during the decade has no much change except for India where the percentage of permanent cropland land has increased slightly.

- The comparision to Agricultural land and permanent cropland is done to check the percentage of cropland for available agricultural land in each country. The median for the agricultural land is 44.49 and for permanent cropland is 4.11. The observed probability factor (P > |t|) is 0.736.

- Food production is the largest source of environmental degradation. To be sustainable, food production must occur within food-related planetary boundaries for climate change, biodiversity loss, land and water use, as well as for nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. As a brief, the food production in India, Thailand and USA are shown below.  <br/>

- Over the span of 8 years, the countries show a diverse effect in food production each year. Through a line graph in time series, these differences are shown. Though there are multiple ups and downs in the scale of food production over a period, it has an inclination at the end showing the increase in food production in the countries.

- Food production compared with Agricultural land area in the country:

- Having a diet which is both sufficient in terms of energy (caloric) requirements and diverse to meet additional nutritional needs is essential for good health. Food insecurities among the people is one of the major issues in the world, which inturn leads to the food scarcity. there is a major issue of food insecurities in Thailand compared to India and USA.

- Due to the various reasons like food scarcity, lack of nutritious food, etc., people face undernourishment issues. The prevalence of undernourishment is shown below through a line graph.

- The permanent cropland in shown in choropleth form to show how much percentage of permanent cropland each country has in the year 2010.

**CONCLUSION:**

There are various changes in the food production, food nourishment and food insecurity in all the countries. As we have seen the graphs comparing the factors among the countries, there are few changes in the food production over the years.
Every country should take care of such concerns like food scarcity/shortage and many more so that people don't die due to hunger.

It can be determined that the percentage of agricultural land has no bigger changes in India and United States over the period of 8 years. Thailand has an increase in its agricultural land to 40%. The permanent cropland also remained same.
