# A Report comparing Food production, Agricultural land and Food insecurities in people.
### Individual Project PART-A
Name: Snigdha Panakanti <br/>

### INTRODUCTION:
Agriculture provides the largest share of food supplies and ensures a critical number of ecosystem services all over the world. Though all the countries are rich in producing food, there are also some insecuirities/scarcity of food in the population.
This report explains the detail analysis of food production, agricultural land area, food insecurities in people and their undernourishment among the three countries over the period of 8 years (2010-2018).
### Analysis and Strategy:
Countries considered:India, USA, Thailand. <br/>
Time Span: 2010 - 2018 <br/>
Data Source: http://www.worlddev.xyz <br/>
Indicators: 
  - Population in total
  - Food Production index
  - Agricultural Land (% of land area)
  - Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population (%)
  - Prevalence of undernourishment (% of population) 
<br/> 
The total agricultural land area in percentage of three countries is shown below in the bar chart. <br/>

- Agricultural Land changes in each country over the span of 2010-2018 is given in the graph below.  <br/>

- Food production is the largest source of environmental degradation. To be sustainable, food production must occur within food-related planetary boundaries for climate change, biodiversity loss, land and water use, as well as for nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. As a brief, the food production in India, Thailand and USA are shown below.  <br/>

- Over the span of 8 years, the countries show a diverse effect in food production each year. Through a line graph in time series, these differences are shown. Though there are multiple ups and downs in the scale of food production over a period, it has an inclination at the end showing the increase in food production in the countries.

- Food production compared with Agricultural land area in the country:

- Having a diet which is both sufficient in terms of energy (caloric) requirements and diverse to meet additional nutritional needs is essential for good health. Food insecurities among the people is one of the major issues in the world, which inturn leads to the food scarcity. there is a major issue of food insecurities in Thailand compared to India and USA.

- Food production vs Food insecurities

Due to the various reasons like food scarcity, lack of nutritious food, etc., people face undernourishment issues. The prevalence of undernourishment is shown below through a line graph.

**Correlation between Food Production, Prevalence of Undernourishment and Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity:**

**CONCLUSION:**

There are various changes in the food production, food nourishment and food insecurity in all the countries. As we have seen the graphs comparing the factors among the countries, there are few changes in the food production over the years.
Every country should take care of such concerns like food scarcity/shortage and many more so that people don't die due to hunger.
